  <!-- 1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT? -->
  <h2 id="collect">1. What Information Do We Collect?</h2>

  <h3>Personal information you disclose to us</h3>

  <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We collect personal information that you provide to us through your use of the KAI Discord bot.</p>

  <p>We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you interact with the Services, participate in activities on the Services, or otherwise contact us. The personal information we collect depends on how you interact with us and the Services, the choices you make, and the features you use.</p>

  <p><strong>Personal Information Provided by You.</strong> The personal information we collect may include the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Discord User IDs and usernames</strong> &mdash; received from Discord as part of normal bot operation</li>
    <li><strong>Usage data</strong> &mdash; talk counts, roll counts, daily active tracking, quest progress, and other interaction analytics</li>
    <li><strong>Conversation content</strong> &mdash; messages sent to AI-powered characters within KAI</li>
    <li><strong>Moderation records</strong> &mdash; bans, reports, and appeals</li>
    <li><strong>Bond/relationship data</strong> &mdash; XP, nicknames, streaks, and other character interaction data</li>
    <li><strong>User-generated content</strong> &mdash; custom characters and content packs created by users</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Sensitive Information.</strong> We do not process sensitive personal information.</p>

  <p><strong>Payment Data.</strong> We may collect data necessary to process your payment if you choose to make purchases. All payment processing is handled entirely by <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stripe</a>. <strong>We do not collect, store, or have access to your credit card numbers, bank account details, or billing address.</strong> We only store a Stripe Customer ID linked to your Discord User ID for the purpose of managing subscriptions and purchase history.</p>

  <p>All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.</p>

  <h3>Information automatically collected</h3>

  <p><strong>In Short:</strong> Some usage information is collected automatically when you interact with the KAI bot.</p>

  <p>Because KAI operates exclusively as a Discord bot, the information we automatically collect is limited to your interactions with the bot within Discord. This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Command usage data</strong> &mdash; which bot commands you use, when, and how frequently</li>
    <li><strong>Interaction timestamps</strong> &mdash; date/time stamps associated with your usage of the Services</li>
    <li><strong>Server context</strong> &mdash; the Discord server (guild) ID where interactions take place</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect your IP address, browser characteristics, device information, operating system, or referring URLs. That information is held by Discord and governed by <a href="https://discord.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

  <!-- 2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION? -->
  <h2 id="process">2. How Do We Process Your Information?</h2>

  <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law.</p>

  <p>We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>To provide and maintain the Services</strong> &mdash; including processing your interactions with AI characters, managing your collection, tracking quests and progression, and handling payments.</li>
    <li><strong>To improve the Services</strong> &mdash; analyzing usage patterns to make the bot better and more enjoyable.</li>
    <li><strong>To communicate with you</strong> &mdash; responding to support requests and providing service-related notifications.</li>
    <li><strong>To ensure security and prevent fraud</strong> &mdash; monitoring for abuse, exploits, and violations of our Terms of Service.</li>
    <li><strong>To comply with legal obligations</strong> &mdash; such as tax reporting, responding to lawful requests, and protecting our rights.</li>
    <li><strong>To save or protect an individual's vital interest</strong> &mdash; such as to prevent harm.</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- 3. WHAT LEGAL BASES? -->
  <h2 id="legal-bases">3. What Legal Bases Do We Rely On to Process Your Personal Information?</h2>

  <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason to do so under applicable law.</p>

  <h3>If you are located in the EU or UK</h3>

  <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. We may rely on the following legal bases:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.</li>
    <li><strong>Performance of a Contract.</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing the Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
    <li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>If you are located in Canada</h3>

  <p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.</p>

  <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>
    <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
    <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
    <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
    <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
    <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
    <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
    <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
    <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>
    <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
    <li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- 4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM? -->
  <h2 id="share">4. When and With Whom Do We Share Your Personal Information?</h2>

  <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.</p>

  <p>We may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents ("third parties") who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. We have contracts in place with our third parties, which are designed to help safeguard your personal information. They cannot do anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them to do it. They will also not share your personal information with any organization apart from us. They also commit to protect the data they hold on our behalf and to retain it for the period we instruct.</p>

  <p>The third parties we share personal information with are:</p>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Service Provider</th>
      <th>Purpose</th>
      <th>Data Shared</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>OpenAI</strong></td>
      <td>AI-powered character conversations and content moderation</td>
      <td>Conversation content (messages sent to AI characters)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Stripe</strong></td>
      <td>Payment processing for subscriptions and purchases</td>
      <td>Payment instrument data (handled directly by Stripe; we only store the Stripe Customer ID)</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>We also may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- 5. AI PRODUCTS -->
  <h2 id="ai">5. Do We Offer Artificial Intelligence-Based Products?</h2>

  <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We offer products, features, or tools powered by artificial intelligence, machine learning, or similar technologies.</p>

  <p>As part of our Services, we offer products, features, or tools powered by artificial intelligence, machine learning, or similar technologies (collectively, "AI Products"). These tools are designed to enhance your experience and provide you with interactive character conversations.</p>

  <h3>Use of AI Technologies</h3>
  <p>We provide the AI Products through third-party service providers ("AI Service Providers"), including <strong>OpenAI</strong>. As outlined in this Privacy Policy, your input, output, and personal information will be shared with and processed by these AI Service Providers to enable your use of our AI Products. You must not use the AI Products in any way that violates the terms or policies of any AI Service Provider.</p>

  <h3>Our AI Products</h3>
  <p>Our AI Products are designed for the following functions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>AI-powered character chatbots with distinct personalities</li>
    <li>Natural language processing for interactive conversations</li>
    <li>Content moderation assistance</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How We Process Your Data Using AI</h3>
  <p>All personal information processed using our AI Products is handled in line with this Privacy Policy and our agreements with third-party service providers. This ensures high security and safeguards your personal information throughout the process.</p>

  <!-- 6. HOW LONG? -->
  <h2 id="retention">6. How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h2>

  <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless otherwise required by law.</p>

  <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). See <a href="#retention-details">Section 12 (Data Retention Details)</a> for specific retention periods by data category.</p>

  <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

  <!-- 7. HOW DO WE KEEP IT SAFE? -->
  <h2 id="security">7. How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?</h2>

  <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>

  <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. These measures include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Encryption in transit:</strong> All data transmitted between our Services and third-party providers (OpenAI, Stripe) uses TLS encryption.</li>
    <li><strong>Secure credential storage:</strong> API keys, tokens, and secrets are stored securely and are not exposed in client-facing code.</li>
    <li><strong>Access controls:</strong> Access to user data is restricted to authorized personnel only.</li>
    <li><strong>Payment security:</strong> All payment processing is handled by Stripe, a PCI DSS Level 1 certified payment processor. We never store full credit card numbers or bank account details.</li>
    <li><strong>Automatic data deletion:</strong> Conversation memory and temporary data are automatically purged on defined schedules (see <a href="#retention-details">Data Retention Details</a>).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

  <!-- 8. YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS -->
  <h2 id="rights">8. What Are Your Privacy Rights?</h2>

  <p><strong>In Short:</strong> Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information.</p>

  <p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To request access and obtain a copy of your personal information</li>
    <li>To request rectification or erasure</li>
    <li>To restrict the processing of your personal information</li>
    <li>If applicable, to data portability</li>
    <li>Not to be subject to automated decision-making</li>
    <li>To object to the processing of your personal information</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If a decision that produces legal or similarly significant effects is made solely by automated means, we will inform you, explain the main factors, and offer a simple way to request human review.</p>

  <p>You can make such a request by contacting us using the contact details provided in the "<a href="#contact">How Can You Contact Us</a>" section below.</p>
