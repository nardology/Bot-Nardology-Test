Multiple worlds — medieval, modern, feudal Japanese, oceanic — were fused together by a catastrophic magical accident called the Shimmer Scar. Wild magic zones exist where reality is unstable. The Old Realm, Modern Quarter, Shattered Seas, and Eastern Reaches are all connected by new geography that didn't exist before. The Void — a formless, sentient darkness between worlds — lurks at the edges and is getting closer.",

The Order of the Silver Shield has protected its borders for 800 years from their fortress, the Bastion, overlooking the Greymarch borderlands.
